# Iris_Flower
Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their petal and sepal measurements. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower when provided with its measurements.

Project Overview
The Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, contains 150 samples with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample includes the following four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these features and classify a new flower into one of the three species.

Steps Involved:
Data Loading: Either use the Iris dataset provided by Scikit-learn or download the dataset from an external source.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training, including handling missing data or scaling if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the dataset using various techniques such as histograms, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps.
Model Selection: Training different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) and comparing their performance.
Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance.
Model Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters for improving the model's performance.
Prediction: Classifying new iris flower measurements based on the trained model.
